# BookQuest

## Description
I have reconfigured a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

## User Story
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase

## Technologies Used

# MongoDB:
A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like BSON documents. MongoDB is used as the backend database in the MERN stack.

# Express.js:
A backend web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications.

# React:
A frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows developers to create reusable UI components, making it easy to manage and update complex user
interfaces.

# Node.js:
A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run server-side JavaScript. Node.js is used as the backend runtime in the MERN stack.

# Mongoose:
An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose provides a schema-based solution to model application data.

# Express.js Middleware:
Middleware such as body-parser and CORS can be used with Express.js to handle request bodies and enable cross-origin resource sharing.

# React Router:
A library for handling navigation in React applications. React Router enables the creation of single-page applications with client-side navigation.

# Webpack:
A module bundler that is often used to bundle JavaScript files, stylesheets, and other assets. Webpack simplifies the deployment of frontend applications.

# Babel:
A JavaScript compiler that allows developers to use the latest ECMAScript features and syntax. Babel transforms modern JavaScript code into a compatible version for various browsers.

# Apollo Client:
A GraphQL client library that can be used with React for handling GraphQL queries and mutations.
